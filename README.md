# Wine-Quality
Coursework from [Harvard CS 109](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs109/2014/blob/master/homework/HW5.ipynb)

Predict wine quality based on the chemical properties of the wine.

A **binary classification** problem, whether the wine is good/bad.

## Data
### Data Source
Wine quality dataset from [UCI website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/)

Focus on the red wine only.

### Data Preview
**11 chemical properties**, including the concentration of sugar, citric acid, alcohol, pH etc.

The **wine qualities** are represented as integers scaling from **1 to 10**.

```python
>>> print(wine.shape)
(1599, 12)
```

## Process

* Data Wrangling
    * Pick out the **feature matrix X & response vector y**, transform them into Numpy arrays
    * Convert 0~10 ratings to good(1)/bad(0) **binary classifications** (Threshold = 7)

* Model Construction 
    * Choose **random forests** method to do the classification
    * Iterate from 1 to 40 to choose the best **'number of decision trees'** parameter
    * For each value of 'number of decision trees', use **cross_val_score** to evaluate model with different train/test splittings
    * Need to consider about the **trade-off** between **classification accuracy & cost of fitting additional trees** 

* Handle Class Imbalance
    *

## Libraries Used
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)

## Appendix
### How to construct a random forest?
> **Construct a multitude of decision trees** at training time and output the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

### Advantages of random forests over decision trees?
> Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of **overfitting** to their training set.

### Sources of randomness in the process that are used to build a diverse set of decision trees?
> The random forest adds randomness in two ways. 

> First, it randomly resamples the data with replacement, so each decision tree is being fit on a **slightly different set of data**. 

> Secondly, for each split in each decision tree, the random forests algorithm only considers **a random subset of variables to split on**. All trees are trained independently of each other. To make predictions, all trees are queried independently and the majority vote wins.

### How to use cross_val_score to help evaluating models?
scores = sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score(model, X=..., y=..., **cv=n**, ...) *(cv: short for cross-validation)*

Evaluate a model by splitting the data, fitting a model and computing the score n consecutive times (with different splits each time).

By default, the score computed at each CV iteration is the score method of the estimator.

### How to deal with class imbalance?
* Undersampling the majority class
* **Oversampling the minority class**
* Use a **asymmetric cost function** to artificially balance the training process

    (assign a higher misclassification penalty on the minority class)
